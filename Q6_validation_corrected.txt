QUESTION 6 CELL VALIDATION REPORT (CORRECTED)
==============================================

HOMEWORK REQUIREMENT:
Report the values μ̄(3, 0), γ̄(3, 0), V̄(3, 0), and V(3, 0, -2)

CELL OUTPUT:
============
μ̄(3, 0)  = 8.472981
γ̄(3, 0)  = 6.979849
V̄(3, 0)  = 8.530970

V(3, 0, -2):
  Given μ_it = -2.0 and μ̄(3, 0) = 8.4730
  μ_it ≤ μ̄(3,0), firm STAYS
  V(3, 0, -2) = 8.472981 (continuation value)

VALIDATION:
===========

1. CUTOFF VALUES (μ̄, γ̄, V̄)
   ✓ CORRECT - These are computed correctly using the equilibrium solver
   - μ̄(3, 0) = π(3, 0) + Ψ₁(3, 0) is the exit value cutoff
   - γ̄(3, 0) = Ψ₂(3, 0) is the entry cost cutoff
   - V̄(3, 0) is the ex-ante expected value before observing μ_it

2. VALUE FUNCTION V(3, 0, -2)
   ✓ CORRECT - Logic is correct based on the Bellman equation
   
   The value function is:
   V(N_t, x_t, μ_it) = max{ μ_it, π(N_t, x_t) + β E[V(N_{t+1}, x_{t+1}, μ_{it+1}) | stay] }
                     = max{ μ_it, μ̄(N_t, x_t) }
   
   Decision rule:
   - If μ_it > μ̄(N_t, x_t): EXIT → V = μ_it (take exit value)
   - If μ_it ≤ μ̄(N_t, x_t): STAY → V = μ̄(N_t, x_t)
   
   For (N=3, x=0, μ_it=-2):
   - μ_it = -2.0 < μ̄(3,0) = 8.473
   - Firm STAYS in the market
   - V(3, 0, -2) = μ̄(3, 0) = 8.472981 ✓

3. IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:
   ⚠️  The label "continuation value" in the cell output is MISLEADING
   
   μ̄(3, 0) = 8.472981 actually consists of:
   - π(3, 0) = current period profit from staying
   - Ψ₁(3, 0) = β × E[V̄(N_{t+1}, x_{t+1})] = discounted continuation value
   
   So μ̄(3, 0) = CURRENT PROFIT + DISCOUNTED CONTINUATION VALUE
   
   It's the TOTAL value from staying, not just continuation!

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
The cell comment should say:
   "V(3, 0, -2) = 8.472981 (total value from staying)"
   
Instead of:
   "V(3, 0, -2) = 8.472981 (continuation value)"

CONCLUSION:
===========
✓ CELL COMPUTATION IS CORRECT
⚠️ CELL COMMENT IS MISLEADING - should clarify that μ̄ is the total 
   value from staying (current profit + continuation), not just continuation

The numerical values are all correct, but the interpretation text
could be clearer about what μ̄ represents.

NOTES:
- V̄(3, 0) = 8.530970 differs from μ̄(3, 0) = 8.472981 because:
  V̄ = Pr(stay) × μ̄ + Pr(exit) × E[μ|exit]
  V̄ integrates over the distribution of μ_it (ex-ante expected value)
  μ̄ is the indifference point cutoff (value from staying = exit value)
  
- The firm with μ_it = -2 stays because the TOTAL value from staying
  (8.473 = current profit + discounted future) exceeds exit payoff (-2)
