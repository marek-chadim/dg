QUESTION 6 CELL VALIDATION REPORT
=====================================

HOMEWORK REQUIREMENT:
Report the values μ̄(3, 0), γ̄(3, 0), V̄(3, 0), and V(3, 0, -2)

CELL OUTPUT:
============
μ̄(3, 0)  = 8.472981
γ̄(3, 0)  = 6.979849
V̄(3, 0)  = 8.530970

V(3, 0, -2):
  Given μ_it = -2.0 and μ̄(3, 0) = 8.4730
  μ_it ≤ μ̄(3,0), firm STAYS
  V(3, 0, -2) = 8.472981 (continuation value)

VALIDATION:
===========

1. CUTOFF VALUES (μ̄, γ̄, V̄)
   ✓ CORRECT - These are computed correctly using the equilibrium solver
   - μ̄(3, 0) = π(3, 0) + Ψ₁(3, 0) is the exit value cutoff
   - γ̄(3, 0) = Ψ₂(3, 0) is the entry cost cutoff
   - V̄(3, 0) is the ex-ante expected value before observing μ_it

2. VALUE FUNCTION V(3, 0, -2)
   ✓ CORRECT - Logic is correct based on the Bellman equation
   
   The value function is:
   V(N_t, x_t, μ_it) = max{ μ_it, π(N_t, x_t) + Ψ₁(N_t, x_t) }
                     = max{ μ_it, μ̄(N_t, x_t) }
   
   Decision rule:
   - If μ_it > μ̄(N_t, x_t): EXIT → V = μ_it (take exit value)
   - If μ_it ≤ μ̄(N_t, x_t): STAY → V = μ̄(N_t, x_t) (continuation value)
   
   For (N=3, x=0, μ_it=-2):
   - μ_it = -2.0 < μ̄(3,0) = 8.473
   - Firm STAYS in the market
   - V(3, 0, -2) = μ̄(3, 0) = 8.472981 ✓

3. CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING
   ✓ The cell correctly implements:
   - The cutoff strategy for exit decisions
   - The max operator in the Bellman equation
   - The interpretation that staying gives continuation value μ̄

CONCLUSION:
===========
✓ CELL IS CORRECT
The implementation properly answers Question 6 and correctly computes all
four requested equilibrium values using the dynamic programming solution.

NOTES:
- V̄(3, 0) = 8.530970 differs from μ̄(3, 0) = 8.472981 because:
  V̄ = Pr(stay) × μ̄ + Pr(exit) × E[μ|exit]
  V̄ integrates over the distribution of μ_it, whereas μ̄ is the cutoff
  
- The firm with μ_it = -2 stays because the continuation value (8.473)
  exceeds the immediate exit payoff (-2)
