Dynamic Demand: Durable Goods

Durable Goods
I Cases in which dynamics matter for durable good purchases:
I Transaction costs and resale markets.
I E.g. scrappage policy.

I Evolving technology/quality.
I Buy today v.s. wait for tomorrow?
I Price elasticity depends on consumers beliefs aboout evolution
of quality/price.
I Firm's optimal pricing problem should take account of
dynamics → lowering price today can cannibalize own sales
tomorrow.

High Tech Durables CPI

High Tech Durables CPI
I Today, a 55 4K LCD TV costs $250. In 2006, a 32 720P TV
cost >$10,000.

I From August 25 to August 2015, prices declined by 87.2%.

I Quality also changes: Reduction in the price of a TV
understates eect of technological change.

I BLS try to do chaining or quality adjustments in CPI.

I Static demand estimation seems inappropriate in this
environment.

I If consumers have rational expectations about evolution of
price and quality.
I Think about decision to buy electric car.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Camcorders

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Camcorders

I Dynamic model of camcorder purchases during a period of.
I Falling prices.
I Increasing quality.

I Allows for:
I Forward looking consumers to delay adoption.
I Preferences heterogeneity: early adopters are (endogenously)
dierent from late adopters.
I Price endogeneity: time-varying unobservable quality ξjt
potentially correlated with price.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Data
I Model-month level market share data (market is a month, t ).
I Like BLP.
I Contrast to Hendel and Nevo, Rust etc.

I Sales, price, other characteristics from 383 model from
2000-2006.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Model

I Flow utility to consumer i from buying model j at time t :
uijt = xjt αix − αip ln(pjt ) + ξjt + ijt
I xjt includes camcorder attributes (size, zoom, screen size).
I pjt is price.
I ξjt is time-varying unobserved quality.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Model
I Flow utility to consumer i from holding model j at time t
(previously purchased):

uijt = xjt αix + ξjt + ijt

I Flow utility to consumer i from holding nothing:
ui 0t = i 0t
I Consumers can upgrade at zero cost
I No second hand market.

I Once consumers own a model, j they can never go back to
owning model 0 nothing.

I For notational convenience, let's denote u0 as the ow utility
of whatever the consumer currently owns.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Model

uijt = xjt αix − αip ln(pjt ) + ξjt
(αix , αip ) ∼ N ((αx , αx ), Σ)
I Σ diagonal.
I Note that this is the population distribution of preferences.
I Not the distribution of preferences conditional on holding
model j at date t.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Model
I Consumer's dynamic problem (dropping i ):
V (u0 , Ω) = E [max{u0 + βE [V (u0 , Ω0 )|Ω] + 0 ,
max {uj + βE [V (uj , Ω0 )|Ω] + j }]

j∈1...J

I Ω is the market state that includes all prices and product
characteristics (including ξjt ), as well as current endowments.
I Everything that determines product characteristics and
evolution of product characteristics.

I Suppose Ω evolves according to a Markov process.
I Consistent with a supply model where products enter
exogenously, and price is set each period in a Markov perfect
equilibrium.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Model
V (u0 , Ω) = E [max{u0 + βE [V (u0 , Ω0 )|Ω] + 0 ,
max {uj + βE [V (uj , Ω0 )|Ω] + j }]

j∈1...J

j∈1...J

I δ(Ω) is the PDV of upgrading to the preferred option at state
Ω.
I Notice that Ω aects V (u0 , Ω) only through current δ(Ω) and
predictions of future δ(Ω)

I δ(Ω) is a sucient statistic for predictions about future δ(Ω)0 .
I Substantive assumption.

Inclusive Value Suciency (Again)
I To compute the continuation values for each choice
E [V (fj , Ω0 )|Ω], only need to condition on δ :

V (u0 , δ) = log exp u0 + βE [V (u0 , δ 0 )|δ] + exp(δ)

j∈1...J

I Reduces state space to a single index for each consumer.
I Note that δit is consumer type specic because it depends on
(αix , αip ) which enter uj .
I Also Vi is consumer type specic...

Inclusive Value Suciency (Again)

I Specify functional form for evolution of δ :
δt+1 = γ1 + γ2 δt + vt+1
vt ∼ N(0, σv )
I Notice that if γ2 ∈ (0, 1), consumers expect δ to converge to
γ1 /(1 − γ2 ).
I Intuitively, δ < γ1 /(1 − γ2 ) early in the data,and inclusive
value expected to rise because of falling prices and improved
products.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Model

I Solving the model for the optimal policy (purchase decisions)
requires:




V (u0 , δ) = log exp u0 + βE [V (u0 , δ 0 )|δ] + exp(δ)


X

δ = log 
exp uj + βE [V (uj , δ 0 )|δ] 
j∈1...J

δt+1 = γ1 + γ2 δt + vt+1
I All three equations to hold.

Gowrisankaran and Rysman (2012): Estimation

I If we had micro-data (as in Hendel and Nevo) we'd be done.
I Solve model and compute likelihood.

I But here, we have market shares.
I And a product-market unobservable ξjt (rationalizes market
shares).

I Idea: for each θ, need to iterate between solving dynamic
model and performing the BLP contraction mapping...

Estimation: Step One (Inner Loop)
1. Guess parameters, θ = (α, Σα ).
2. Initialize values functions V (u0 , δ) = 0.
3. Initialize ξ = 0
4. Given value functions, can compute inclusive values:




δ = log 

X


exp uj + βE [V (uj , δ 0 )|δ] 

j∈1...J
5. Draw consumers from F (αi ) (e.g. grid of types). Estimate

δit+1 = γ1 + γ2 δit + vt+1
6. Iterate Bellman equation:




V (u0 , δ) = log exp u0 + βE [V (u0 , δ 0 )|δ] + exp(δ)


X

δ = log 
exp uj + βE [V (uj , δ 0 )|δ] 
j∈1...J
7. Repeat from (4) until convergence

Estimation: Step Two (Middle Loop)
1. You have solved for Vi (u0 , δ) for a xed vector of parameters θ
and unobservables ξ .
2. Simulate market shares.

2.1 Draw consumers at date 0 from F (αi ).
2.2 Simulate purchases for each consumer, move to date 1.
2.3 etc. Keeping track of what model each consumer holds.
3. This generates model-implied market shares for eahch period:

ŝjt (θ, ξ).
4. Perform BLP contraction mapping by comparing ŝjt (θ, ξ) to
observed sjt .:

ξ 0 = ξ + log (sjt ) − log (ŝjt (θ, ξ))
5. Notice that on each iteration, you have to go back and do step
one (the inner loop) over again!

Estimation: Step Three (Outer Loop)

1. Now you can take a parameters vector, θ , and compute the
unobservables, ξ , that rationalize the observed market shares!
2. The rest of the estimation is just like BLP.
3. Form moments, E (ξjt zjt ) = 0
4. Apply GMM.

I BLP + dynamic consistency restriction.
I Have to assume a unique xed point exists for this whole thing
(try dierent starting values).

Identication & Instruments
I Identication is similar to BLP.
I The addition of dynamic consistency in choices actually
provides additional identifying power.

I Intertemporal substitution.
I E.g. a price reduction for a low quality mode at date t should
induce substitution from similat models at date t + 1.

I BLP-type instruments:
I Model characteristics of same and other rms.
I Model count of same and other rms.

I Note: cannot directly observe repeated purchases (or who
bought what).

I Micro-data would add identifying power.

G&R: Results

I Column 4 includes micro-moment on penetration (share of
households holding some model).

G&R: Results

G&R: Results

I BLS and Pakes COLI are basically Laspeyres:

P
j pjt sjt

shows how the value of the market increasing over time.

I COLI from model is essentially growth in mean utility from
sales at date t . Notice divergence.
I Dynamic selection of heterogeneous consumers.

Hodgson (2023)

I Durable goods demand with a resale market.
I Also see Schrialdi (2011).

I Combine BLP approach with micro-moments.
I Can see which consumers upgraded from j to k at each date.

Hodgson (2023): Setting
I Market for Business Jets: 1961-2000.
I Concentrated market for new jets.
I Active resale market.
I Data on full history of ownership from FAA.

Hodgson (2023): Setting

I Why do manufacturers accept own brand trade-ins?
I If there are transaction costs to upgrading, consumers will hold
old models when they might prefer to buy a new model.
I Trade-ins modeled as a way to reduce transaction costs for
upgrading consumers.

I But trade-ins are resold on the used market!
I Increase in supply of used jets can cannibalize new jet sales.
I First time buyers benet from lower used jet prices.

Hodgson (2023): Model
I Consumer i gets ow utilities:
i
ujjt

= γijt + ijt

i
ukjt
uki 0t

= γijt + γ̃kj + (pkt − pjt ) αip − τikj + ijt
= pkt αip − τik 0 + i 0t .

I τijk is the transaction cost for upgrading from j to k .
I Unlike in G&R, consumers can sell model j and drop out of
market (alternative 0).

I Assume τijk is reduced if j and k same brand and k is new
(same-brand trade in):


τikj = τ − newjt 1(m(j) = m(k))bm(j) 1(j 6= 0)+τ exit 1(j = 0)+νiτ

Hodgson (2023): Model

Vi (k, Ωit , it ) = max

k∈Jt ∪0

n
o
i
uj(i,t)k
+ ikt + E [δikt+1 |Ωit ]

I Consumer's problem looks pretty similar to G&R.
I Make inclusive value assumption.
I Now, inclusive value depends on what model you currently
hold.

I eligibility for trade-ins varies by model held.

Hodgson (2023): Estimation
I Estimation uses BLP-moments and micro-moments:

Hodgson (2023): Results

I Solve for equilibrium new and used jet prices.
I Firms maximize static prot.
I All used jet markets clear!

Hodgson (2023): Results
I Use the estimated model that under reasonable assumptions
on the cost of trade-ins to the rm...

I e.g. rms eat the transaction costs that consumers don't have
to pay if they trade in.

I Then all rms oering trade-ins is a prisoners' dilemma
equilibrium!

I Cessna only accepts trade-ins because all other rms accept
trade-ins.

I Under a hypothetical merger between Cessa and Learjet,
trade-ins would no longer be optimal.

Hodgson (2023): Results

Hodgson (2023)

I By the way, this started out as my second year paper.
I No dynamics in rst version.
I Repeated static choice.

I Started work 2015 - published 2023.
I Try to be faster than this.
