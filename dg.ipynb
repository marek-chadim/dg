    "## Question 2: Intuition for Cutoff Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does a cutoff equilibrium make intuitive sense in this setup?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A cutoff equilibrium is intuitive for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Decisions with Continuous Shocks**: Each firm makes a binary choice (stay/exit, enter/don't enter) based on a single continuous private shock ($\\mu_{it}$ or $\\gamma_{it}$). This naturally leads to a threshold rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monotonicity**: \n",
    "   - For incumbents: Higher exit values $\\mu_{it}$ make exiting more attractive. There exists a threshold $\\mu(N_t, x_t)$ such that firms with $\\mu_{it} > \\mu(N_t, x_t)$ prefer to exit.\n",
    "   - For entrants: Higher entry costs $\\gamma_{it}$ make entering less attractive. There exists a threshold $\\gamma(N_t, x_t)$ such that firms with $\\gamma_{it} > \\gamma(N_t, x_t)$ prefer not to enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetric Information about State**: All firms observe the public state $(N_t, x_t)$ and face the same continuation value structure. Only the private shocks differ, so all firms use the same cutoff strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additively Separable Payoffs**: The payoff structure is:\n",
    "   - Exit: $\\mu_{it}$ (immediate)\n",
    "   - Stay: $\\pi(N_t, x_t) + \\beta \\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}]$ (independent of $\\mu_{it}$)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The comparison reduces to $\\mu_{it}$ vs. $\\pi(N_t, x_t) + \\beta \\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}]$, defining a natural cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connection to Discrete Choice**: As Ryan (2024) notes, this is analogous to using probit models for entry/exit decisions in empirical work—agents with shocks above/below a threshold make different choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cutoff characterization simplifies both the theoretical analysis and computational implementation, as we only need to track $\\mu(N_t, x_t)$ and $\\gamma(N_t, x_t)$ rather than full policy functions over the continuous shock space."

    "## Question 3: Interpretation of $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe (at an intuitive level) what $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ measures. How does this relate to the alternative specific value functions of Rust (1987)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ represents the **ex-ante expected value** for an incumbent firm in state $(N_t, x_t)$ **before observing the private exit value shock** $\\mu_{it}$. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t) = \\int V(N_t, x_t, \\mu_{it}) p(d\\mu_{it})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(d\\mu_{it})$ is the density of the normal distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma_\\mu^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ex-Ante vs. Interim Value**: \n",
    "   - $V(N_t, x_t, \\mu_{it})$ is the **interim** value function, conditional on observing both the public state and the private shock\n",
    "   - $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ is the **ex-ante** value function, conditional only on the public state\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Over Private Information**: $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ averages over all possible realizations of $\\mu_{it}$, weighted by their probability. This captures the expected value of being an incumbent before learning whether you got a good or bad exit opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Role in BBL**: Following Ryan (2024), the value function can be written as:\n",
    "   $$V(s) = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\pi(s_t; a^*(s_t))$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The BBL insight is that we can **replace the value function with an infinite sum of payoffs**, using observed optimal actions $a^*(s_t)$ and empirical transitions from data, avoiding the need to solve the Bellman equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Rust (1987)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rust's framework for dynamic discrete choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative-Specific Value Functions**: $v_i(x, \\epsilon)$ represents the value of choosing action $i$ in state $x$ with shock vector $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated (Social Surplus) Value Function**: \n",
    "  $$V(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\epsilon}\\left[\\max_i v_i(x, \\epsilon)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ is analogous to Rust's $V(x)$:\n",
    "- Both integrate over the idiosyncratic shocks\n",
    "- Both represent the expected value before observing choice-specific shocks\n",
    "- Both separate the **structural component** (public state) from the **idiosyncratic component** (private shocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncated Normal Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the cutoff $\\mu(N_t, x_t)$, we can compute $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ analytically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t) = \\Pr(\\text{exit}) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{it} | \\mu_{it} > \\mu(N_t, x_t)] + \\Pr(\\text{stay}) \\cdot \\mu(N_t, x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the conditional expectation uses the truncated normal distribution:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{it} | \\mu_{it} > \\mu(N_t, x_t)] = \\mu + \\sigma_\\mu \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)}$$\n",

    "## Questions 9-10: BBL Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**9) Using the simulated data from Question 7, use a BBL-like estimator to estimate $\\gamma$, $\\sigma_\\gamma^2$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma_\\mu^2$. In other words assume you know everything about the model (demand, fixed and marginal costs, discount factor, $p(x_{t+1}|x_t)$ distribution) except for these 4 parameters, and estimate them. More specifically, estimation should proceed as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A)** Estimate the reduced form expected policy functions, $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$ and $\\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$, directly from the data. At each state, these policy functions tell us, respectively, 1) the probability that any specific incumbent stays in the market, and 2) the probability that the potential entrant enters. You can estimate these with a frequency simulator, e.g. $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$ is the proportion of all incumbents in the data at state $(N_t, x_t)$ who decided to stay in the market, $\\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$ is the proportion of times in the data where at state $(N_t, x_t)$, the entrant decided to enter. Note that you do not need to estimate $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$ when $N_t = 0$, nor do you need to estimate $\\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$ when $N_t = 5$ (if you want, you can just set $\\hat{d}(0, x_t) = \\hat{e}(5, x_t) = 0$). If there are other states $(N_t, x_t)$ that are never reached in the dataset, use the values of $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$ and $\\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$ from a nearby state that was observed in the data. Alternatively, you can estimate $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$ and $\\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$ using a probit or logit model with a high order polynomial in $N_t$ and $x_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B)** Guess the parameters $\\gamma$, $\\sigma_\\gamma^2$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma_\\mu^2$. At each possible value of the state, use $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$, $\\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$, $\\pi(N_t, x_t)$ and $Pr(x_{t+1}|x_t)$ to \"forward\" simulate the PDV of one of the incumbents (call this firm \"Firm 1\") conditional on that firm deciding not to exit in the initial period (clearly, you can't do this at states where $N_t = 0$). This involves simulating 1) decisions of potential entrants in the current period and the future, 2) decisions of firms other than Firm 1 in the current period and the future, and 3) decisions of Firm 1 in the future (since we are already conditioning on Firm 1 not exiting in the current period, we don't need to simulate Firm 1's current decision). To simulate all these decisions, you will need to take draws of $\\mu_{it}$ and $\\gamma_{it}$ (these draws will obviously depend on the parameters. Create them by taking draws from $N(0,1)$'s, multiplying by $\\sigma_\\mu$ (or $\\sigma_\\gamma$) and adding $\\mu$ (or $\\gamma$). **Importantly (and like we did in the BLP problem set), hold the underlying $N(0,1)$ draws constant as the parameters change** (also hold the draws on the $x_t$ process the same across simulations). Given such draws, an incumbent stays in the market if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{it} - \\mu}{\\sigma_\\mu}\\right) \\leq \\hat{d}(N_t, x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and an entrant enters if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{it} - \\gamma}{\\sigma_\\gamma}\\right) \\leq \\hat{e}(N_t, x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these equations are implied by the cutoff equilibrium, because if, e.g. $\\hat{d}(N_t, x_t) = 0.25$, then firms with $\\mu_{it}$'s in the lower quartile of the distribution must be the ones that are staying in the market. Simulate forward in time until either Firm 1 exits the market (or until $t$ gets very large, e.g. 100) and add up Firm 1's total discounted profits. Note that if Firm 1 eventually exits, you will need to add her simulated $\\mu_{it}$ in that period (appropriately discounted) into total profits to compute the simulated total stream of profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C)** Do the above forward simulation process 50 times for one of the incumbents in each of the 15 states (i.e. all the states except those with $N_t = 0$), and average across these 50 runs to get an expectation of this PDV. Call these values $\\Lambda(N_t, x_t | \\gamma, \\sigma_\\gamma^2, \\mu, \\sigma_\\mu^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D)** Note that according to the model, a firm will stay in the market if\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_{it} < \\Lambda(N_t, x_t | \\gamma, \\sigma_\\gamma^2, \\mu, \\sigma_\\mu^2)$$\n",

    "$$Pr(\\text{incumbent \"stays in\" at } N_t, x_t | \\gamma, \\sigma_\\gamma^2, \\mu, \\sigma_\\mu^2) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda(N_t, x_t | \\gamma, \\sigma_\\gamma^2, \\mu, \\sigma_\\mu^2) - \\mu}{\\sigma_\\mu}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
