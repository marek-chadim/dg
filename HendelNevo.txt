Dynamic Demand: Storable Goods

Dynamic Demand

I So far, you've studied:
I Static models of demand (e.g. BLP).
I Single agent Dynamic Decision Problems (e.g. Rust)

I Today we'll start putting these together.
I Demand estimation when consumers are forward looking.

Dynamic Demand 1: Durable Goods
I When are dynamics important in consumer demand?
I Two canonical cases:
1. Durable goods.

I E.g. market for cars.
I Value of buying a car is the PDV of expected future utility
ows.

uijt = E

"∞
X
t=0

#
t

β vij(t) + pj(t−1)t − pj(t) − τ (j(t) 6= j(t − 1))

I Where j(t) is the model held at date t . τ is the transaction
cost of upgrading.

I Expectation is over future sales and purchases.
I Value of buying model j now depends on future option value of
selling it.

Dynamic Demand 1: Durable Goods

uijt = E

"∞
X
t=0

#
t

β vij(t) + pj(t−1)t − pj(t) − τ (j(t) 6= j(t − 1))

I so why can't we just run BLP and let uijt be a reduced form
of future utility ows?

I We can (this is one way to think about what BLP is doing).
I But we can't then think about counterfactual policies that
change dynamic incentives.

I e.g. a scrappage scheme for old cars (cash for clunkers).
I Changes τ for old cars.
I Need to solve dynamic model to work out how this changes
uijt .

Dynamic Demand 2: Storable Goods
I When are dynamics important in consumer demand?
I Two canonical cases:
1. Durable goods.
2. Storable goods.

I What if I can buy now and consume later?
I i.e. consumers can hold
eat the ow utility.

inventories

of products and wait to

I If prices vary over time...
I Or consumer believe prices vary over time...
I Dynamic incentive to wait until products are on sale and then
stock up.

Dynamic Demand 2: Storable Goods
I E.g. price of 2 liter coke from Hendel and Nevo (2011)

Dynamic Demand 2: Storable Goods

I E.g. price of 2 liter coke from Hendel and Nevo (2011)

Dynamic Demand 2: Storable Goods
I Why is this a problem from static demand estimation?
I When supermarket cuts the price of laundry detergent for a
week there is a huge increase in sales.

I This leads us to conclude that consumers are extremely elastic
to price.

I But when price is cut permanently, there is little impact on
sales!

I Standard demand estimation pools all this price variation.
I Overestimate price elasticity if lots of price variation comes
from sales and products are storable.

Hendel and Nevo (2006)

I Model of dynamic demand for laundry detergent.
I Purchase - storage - consumption.
I How do demand estimates that account for inventories dier
from static demand estimates?

I Household scanner data from 9 supermarkets in Chicago.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Model
I Product characteristics:
I For each brand (j ), size (x ) and week (t ):
1. Price pjxt
2. Quantity qjxt
3. Promotions ajxt (dummies for feature and display)

I Consumer of type h has utility u(cht + νht ; θh ).
P
I Current consumption is cht = j cjht . Not brand specic!
I i.i.d shock to marginal value of consumption νht .
I Observed Action: dhjxt = 1 is a purchase of brand j size x at
date t by household h.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Model
I Consumer's problem:
I State variable st = {pt , at , it }.
I pt and at vectors with entry for each product.
I it is the consumer's current inventory or stock of detergent.

I Policy functions c(st ) and djx (st ).

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Model
I Key assumptions on state variables:
I it+1 = tt + xt − ct .
I jxt iid type 1 extreme value. vt distributed iid log normal.
I pjxt and ajxt follow exogenous rst order Markov process!
I Price endogeneity?
I ξhjx are xed eects.
I Assumption of no time varying unobservable component.

I Still hard to explain why a 1st order Markov process is
reasonable...

I Maybe it is a good representation of consumers' beliefs?

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Likelihood
I For each consumer, we observe a sequence of price and
promotion variables (pt , at ), and the purchase decisions dt .
I We do not observe inventories it or consumption choices ct .
I it is an unobserved, serially correlated state variable!
I Evolution of it is a function of optimal consumption choices
ct (st ) (unobserved) and purchases dt (st ) observed.
I Assumption A: 1st order Markov in observed and unobserved
state.

I Likelihood conditional on the initial inventory:

I This is why we can't use CCP methods for estimation here.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Likelihood

I Model denes optimal policy functions c(st ) and dt (st ).
I Suppose we can solve the model.
I Optimal policy functions give us F (it+1 |it , dt ).
I But model does not dene F (i1 )
I Initial conditions problem!

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Likelihood

I Hendel and Nevo's solution:
I For each candidate parameter vector, θ, solve the model.
I Set i0 = 0. Simulate optimal choices for the rst T0 periods
(using actual prices).

I Use distribution of simulated iT0 as F (i1 ).
I Estimate the model on data from (T0 + 1) → T

I Assumption: by period T0 we have reached stationary
distribution.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Model Specication
I So we can write down a likelihood if we can solve the model
for c(st ) and dt (st ).
I Back to the model...
V (st ) = Et ,vt max {u(ct , vt , θ) − C (it+1 ; θ) + m(dt ; θ) + E [V (st+1 )|st , dt , ct ]}
ct dt

I u(c, v ; θ) = γ ln(ct + vt )
2
I C (it+1 ; θ) = δ1 it+1 + δ2 it+
1
P
I m(dt ; θ) = j,x djxt (αpjxt + ξjx + βajxt + jxt )

I In principle, can guess θ and use value function iteration to
solve for optimal policy functions c(s) and d(s).
I Problem: large state space.
I Recall: st = {pt , at , it }.
I If there are N products, this has dimension 3N + 1

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Estimator

I Hendel and Nevo reduce complexity by proposing a 3-step
estimator:
1. Maximize likelihood of band choice conditional on size choice
(static).
2. Compute inclusive value of each size and transition
probabilities.
3. Solve xed point for reduces state space (one price index per
size)

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Step One


V (st ) = Et ,vt max {u(ct , vt , θ) − C (it+1 ; θ) + m(dt ; θ) + E [V (st+1 )|st , dt , ct ]}
ct dt

I Notice that conditional on choosing a package size, x , brand
choice , j , does not enter the continuation values.
I The distribution of tomorrow's state only depends on how
much detergent you buy, not which band.

I So we can separate the decisions of how much to buy
(dynamic) and which brand (static).

I Brand CCP:
exp(αpjxt + ξjx + βajxt )
k exp(αpkxt + ξkx + βakxt )

P(djx |xt , pt ) = P

I Estimate using simple MLE.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Step Two


V (st ) = Et ,vt max {u(ct , vt , θ) − C (it+1 ; θ) + ωt (xt ) + xt + E [V (st+1 )|st , xt , ct ]}
ct xt

I Now the problem is only about choosing xt and ct .
I ωt (xt ) is the period t inclusive value of the static brand
choice for size t :
!
X
ωt (xt ) = log
exp(αpkxt + ξkx + βakxt )
k

I Notice that the high dimensional state variables {pt , at } only
enter the problem through ωt .

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Step Two


V (st ) = Et ,vt max {u(ct , vt , θ) − C (it+1 ; θ) + ωt (xt ) + xt + E [V (st+1 )|st , xt , ct ]}
ct xt

I Assumption:

Inclusive Value Suciency
F (ωt |st−1 ) = F (ωt |ωt−1 )

I Then we can reduce the state space to:
st = {ωt , it }.
I ωt is a 5-vector.
I What does this mean?
I Assume that the quality adjusted price index ωt follows a 1st
order Markov process.

I Only need to keep track of an index of prices and qualities, not
individual prices.

I A substantive assumption! (testable)

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Step Two

I Compute ωt using 1st step estimates:
!
ωt (xt ) = log

X

exp(αpkxt + ξkx + βakxt )

k

I Then estimate transition process:
F (ωt |st−1 ) = F (ωt |ωt−1 )

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Step Three

I Finally, can solve the model on the reduced state space using
value function iteration.

I H&N approximate value function V (st ) using a smooth
polynomial in st .
I Use policy functions to get (simulated) likelihood.
I Remaining parameters: u(c, v ; θ) = γ ln(ct + vt )

I C (it+1 ; θ) = δ1 it+1 + δ2 it+

I Static parameters:
I Large eects from feature and display.
I Demographics interact with price sensitivity (larger family,
nonwhite, suburban shoppers more price sensitive).

I Brand preference varies by size.

I Dynamic parameters:
I Storage cost: suburban < urban.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Results

I Ratio of static elasticity to dynamic (long run) elasticity.
I Change in column price on row quantity.

Hendel and Nevo (2006): Results

I Static model ignores inventory problem
1. Larger static own price elasticity.
2. Lower static cross price elasticity.

I In the data, response to sales comes from people going from
not buying to buying the sales brand.

I → in static model, get small cross price elasticities with
respect to other products, and large cross price elasticity with
respect to the outside good.
