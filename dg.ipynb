    "## Question 2: Intuition for Cutoff Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does a cutoff equilibrium make intuitive sense in this setup?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A cutoff equilibrium is intuitive for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Decisions with Continuous Shocks**: Each firm makes a binary choice (stay/exit, enter/don't enter) based on a single continuous private shock ($\\mu_{it}$ or $\\gamma_{it}$). This naturally leads to a threshold rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monotonicity**: \n",
    "   - For incumbents: Higher exit values $\\mu_{it}$ make exiting more attractive. There exists a threshold $\\mu(N_t, x_t)$ such that firms with $\\mu_{it} > \\mu(N_t, x_t)$ prefer to exit.\n",
    "   - For entrants: Higher entry costs $\\gamma_{it}$ make entering less attractive. There exists a threshold $\\gamma(N_t, x_t)$ such that firms with $\\gamma_{it} > \\gamma(N_t, x_t)$ prefer not to enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetric Information about State**: All firms observe the public state $(N_t, x_t)$ and face the same continuation value structure. Only the private shocks differ, so all firms use the same cutoff strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additively Separable Payoffs**: The payoff structure is:\n",
    "   - Exit: $\\mu_{it}$ (immediate)\n",
    "   - Stay: $\\pi(N_t, x_t) + \\beta \\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}]$ (independent of $\\mu_{it}$)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The comparison reduces to $\\mu_{it}$ vs. $\\pi(N_t, x_t) + \\beta \\mathbb{E}[V_{t+1}]$, defining a natural cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connection to Discrete Choice**: As Ryan (2024) notes, this is analogous to using probit models for entry/exit decisions in empirical work—agents with shocks above/below a threshold make different choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cutoff characterization simplifies both the theoretical analysis and computational implementation, as we only need to track $\\mu(N_t, x_t)$ and $\\gamma(N_t, x_t)$ rather than full policy functions over the continuous shock space."

    "## Question 3: Interpretation of $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe (at an intuitive level) what $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ measures. How does this relate to the alternative specific value functions of Rust (1987)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ represents the **ex-ante expected value** for an incumbent firm in state $(N_t, x_t)$ **before observing the private exit value shock** $\\mu_{it}$. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t) = \\int V(N_t, x_t, \\mu_{it}) p(d\\mu_{it})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(d\\mu_{it})$ is the density of the normal distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma_\\mu^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ex-Ante vs. Interim Value**: \n",
    "   - $V(N_t, x_t, \\mu_{it})$ is the **interim** value function, conditional on observing both the public state and the private shock\n",
    "   - $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ is the **ex-ante** value function, conditional only on the public state\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Over Private Information**: $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ averages over all possible realizations of $\\mu_{it}$, weighted by their probability. This captures the expected value of being an incumbent before learning whether you got a good or bad exit opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Role in BBL**: Following Ryan (2024), the value function can be written as:\n",
    "   $$V(s) = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\pi(s_t; a^*(s_t))$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The BBL insight is that we can **replace the value function with an infinite sum of payoffs**, using observed optimal actions $a^*(s_t)$ and empirical transitions from data, avoiding the need to solve the Bellman equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Rust (1987)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rust's framework for dynamic discrete choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative-Specific Value Functions**: $v_i(x, \\epsilon)$ represents the value of choosing action $i$ in state $x$ with shock vector $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated (Social Surplus) Value Function**: \n",
    "  $$V(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\epsilon}\\left[\\max_i v_i(x, \\epsilon)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ is analogous to Rust's $V(x)$:\n",
    "- Both integrate over the idiosyncratic shocks\n",
    "- Both represent the expected value before observing choice-specific shocks\n",
    "- Both separate the **structural component** (public state) from the **idiosyncratic component** (private shocks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truncated Normal Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the cutoff $\\mu(N_t, x_t)$, we can compute $\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t)$ analytically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{V}(N_t, x_t) = \\Pr(\\text{exit}) \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{it} | \\mu_{it} > \\mu(N_t, x_t)] + \\Pr(\\text{stay}) \\cdot \\mu(N_t, x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the conditional expectation uses the truncated normal distribution:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[\\mu_{it} | \\mu_{it} > \\mu(N_t, x_t)] = \\mu + \\sigma_\\mu \\frac{\\phi(z)}{1 - \\Phi(z)}$$\n",
    "\n",
